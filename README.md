# Kingdom Duels Deck Builder

[Kingdom Duels](https://kingdomduels.carrd.co/) is a variant of the Yu-Gi-Oh! card game played with its own set of cards and rules. Itâ€™s a recreation of the thematic spirit of the Duelist Kingdom Arc from the Anime, adapting those "weird rules" to an actual game with intricate rules and crazy mechanics.

## Deck Builder

This is a web application that allows you to plan your own Deck:

- Filter by card name, code, frame, types or set.
- Left Click on a card to add it to the corresponding Main Deck or Extra Deck.
- Right Click on a card to zoom.
- Export your build to a .json file to save your changes in your own computer.
- Import the .json file for quick edits.
- Preview your combined Main Deck + Extra Deck.
- Save your deck to a textfile to use as a reference.

Once you have your deck completed you can go to the Tabletop Simulator mod of the game and build an actual deck to play using the output of this web application as a reference. Sadly there is no directly importing to the Tabletop Simulator mod so this will be the closest we get to that i think, but i hope it proves to be useful.
